These instructions are to download R and RStudio so that you can use them locally on your machine.

1.	Download R. Go to the [main R page](https://www.r-project.org/).   

&nbsp;  

2.	Click on “download R”.

3.	Pick a CRAN mirror, any CRAN mirror. I usually pick UCLA, because, GO BRUINS!

&nbsp;  

4.	Choose your operating system

&nbsp;  

6.	Finish installing R as you would any new application. This procedure will vary by operating system.  

&nbsp;  

7.	Download RStudio. Go to [this page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).   

&nbsp;  

8.	Click the green “Download” button under the free column.

9.	Pick your operating system.

10.	Finish installing RStudio as you would any new application. This procedure will vary by operating system.  

&nbsp;  

11.	You will ALWAYS open the RStudio application to work, never R. It’s just that you need R installed to use RStudio—R is running in the background whenever you use RStudio.  

&nbsp;  

12. To install the anticipated packages you'll need for this workshop, run the following code:  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
p_needed <- c("tidyverse", "lubridate", "stringr", "devtools", 
              "ggmap", "GGally", "ggbeeswarm",
              "mosaic", "lme4", "nlme", "ppcor", "knitr", 
              "rmarkdown", "markdown", "gee", "haven", 
              "psych","foreign","lavaan")

packages <- rownames(installed.packages())

p_to_install <- p_needed[!(p_needed %in% packages)]

if(length(p_to_install) > 0){
  install.packages(p_to_install)
  }

lapply(p_needed, require, character.only = TRUE)

install_github("RandiLGarcia/dyadr")
library(dyadr)
```

&nbsp;  

13. Enjoy! :)
